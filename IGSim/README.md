# Instagram iOS App Simulator
This program simulates the Instagram iOS app (or at least an old version of it). It lets you insert custom photos, captions and profile pictures. It requires [Processing 3](processing.org).

When you start the program it will prompt you for a data folder. The data folder must have `config.txt`, which will include user and photo data and reference other image files in the folder. An example data folder is included.

Once the images have loaded, you can scroll by clicking and dragging, with the scroll wheel, or with the arrow keys. You can click "more" to expand longer captions. Many user interface elements are non-functional.
